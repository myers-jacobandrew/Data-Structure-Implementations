# Breadth First Search Implementation

This is an implementation of Breadth First Search algorithm in Java, created by Jacob Myers. The program takes an input file containing an adjacency matrix and outputs a shortest path tree adjacency matrix and each coordinate along diagonal contains the distance from the source to each vertex once the algorithm is completed.

## Usage

To use this program, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can then run the program in your terminal or command prompt using the following command:

`java breadthfirstSearch`

The program will prompt you to enter the name of an input file containing the adjacency matrix. Once you enter the file name, the program will parse the file and run the Breadth First Search algorithm on the input graph.

## Input File Format

The input file should contain a square adjacency matrix with the weights of the edges between each pair of vertices. The weights can be integers or the string "inf" to represent infinite weights.

## Output

The program outputs an adjacency matrix of the shortest path tree and each coordinate along diagonal contains the distance from the source to each vertex once the algorithm is completed.
