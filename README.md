# Java Implementations

This repository contains Java implementations for various data structures and algorithms.

## BreadthFirstSearch

`BreadthFirstSearch` is an algorithm for traversing a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm visits all the vertices of the graph or tree at a given depth before moving on to the vertices at the next depth level.

## Bucket Sort

`BucketSort` is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, and the sorted buckets are concatenated to produce the final sorted array.

## DepthFirstSearch

`DepthFirstSearch` is an algorithm for traversing a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Dijkstra's Shortest Path

`Dijkstra's Shortest Path` is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by maintaining a set of unexplored nodes, and a set of explored nodes. At each step, the algorithm chooses the unexplored node with the smallest known distance to the source node, and adds it to the explored set.

## Double Hash

`Double Hash` is a hash table implementation that uses two hash functions to compute the index of an item in the table. If a collision occurs, the algorithm uses a second hash function to find an alternate index.

## Doubly-Linked List

`Doubly-Linked List` is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes. Each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence, and a reference to the previous node. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both forward and backward directions.

## Max Heap

`Max Heap` is a binary tree data structure in which each parent node is greater than or equal to its child nodes. The root node contains the largest element in the tree.

## Merge Sort

`Merge Sort` is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing an array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.

## Queue

`Queue` is a data structure that works by maintaining a first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering of elements. The `Queue` interface defines methods for adding elements to the back of the queue, removing elements from the front of the queue, and checking the size of the queue.

## RedBlackTree

`RedBlackTree` is a binary search tree that maintains a balance by using a set of rules to determine when to restructure the tree. These rules ensure that the tree remains balanced, and that the worst-case time complexity of operations such as insertion and deletion is O(log n).

## Splay Tree

`Splay Tree` is a self-adjusting binary search tree that rearranges its structure to bring frequently accessed elements closer to the root. This results in faster access times for frequently accessed elements.

## Stack

`Stack` is a data structure that works by maintaining a last-in, first-out (LIFO) ordering of elements. The `Stack` interface defines methods for adding elements to the top of the stack, removing elements from the top of the stack, and checking the size of the stack.
